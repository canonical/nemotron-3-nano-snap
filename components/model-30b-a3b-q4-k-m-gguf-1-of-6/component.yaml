  # The model is split into multiple shards, maintained in individual component directories.
  # However, llama-server expects the shards to be located in the same directory. 
  # To work around it, the engine's server script creates symlinks on runtime to flatten them into a single directory.
  # The model file path is set to the first shard's symlink:
